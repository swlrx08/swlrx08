About Me

Hi, I'm a backend developer with extensive experience in Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF). My work focuses on building scalable, robust, and secure web applications, with a specialization in car showroom platforms, user authentication, and complex coordination systems.

I have successfully completed several large-scale projects, including:

A car showroom management system with distinct admin roles and user management.

Implementation of advanced features such as product (car) registration, buyer queue management, and appointment coordination.

Integration with external services like Melipayamak SMS for sending notifications.
